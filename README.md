DEI Builders Career Platform — README
## Overview

DEI Builders is a career development platform designed to help students upload resumes, analyze their skills, and receive tailored insights for professional growth. The system focuses on accessibility, ease of use, and supporting diverse users as they prepare for internships, jobs, and opportunities.

This project is developed by Bryce Anderson, Taylor Sharperson, and Madison McNealy.

## Project Purpose

The career website will allow students to:

Upload their resumes (PDF or DOCX)

Have their resumes analyzed for skills and experience

View insights on a dashboard

Store files securely

Access a clean, intuitive interface built with Bootstrap 5.3 and FontAwesome

This initial release focuses on delivering a vertical slice that completes the resume upload process end‑to‑end.
