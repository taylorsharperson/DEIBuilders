# Reflection

The system developed aligns strongly with the original SAR and requirements by prioritizing accessibility, usability, and professional growth. Core features such as resume upload, skill insights, mentorship requests, and workshop navigation were implemented in line with the specifications, ensuring that users can easily engage with the platform. The emphasis on clarity and inclusivity reflects the accessibility goals outlined at the start, making the system approachable for a wide range of learners. Throughout the project, teamwork and communication proved essential, with agile practices such as stand‑ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives helping to maintain alignment and transparency. Shared documentation and clear role definitions allowed contributors to collaborate effectively, reducing misunderstandings and keeping progress steady. Over successive sprints, architectural, documentation, and testing practices matured significantly. Early iterations focused on establishing a functional baseline, while later sprints emphasized modular design, scalability, and integration of feedback. Documentation evolved from simple outlines into comprehensive guides that supported onboarding and long‑term maintenance, while testing expanded from unit checks to integration and user acceptance testing, ensuring reliability and robustness. AI played a meaningful role in shaping the development process and decision‑making, offering insights, automating repetitive tasks, and supporting design choices with data‑driven recommendations. It streamlined documentation and testing, reducing manual overhead and enabling faster iterations. By integrating AI into workflows, the team was able to focus more on strategic problem‑solving and innovation, ultimately delivering a system that met requirements while exceeding expectations in usability and adaptability.
